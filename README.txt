ChromaVision is an app to help those with colorblindness.

The app lets you either capture a picture with your camera or load a picture already stored on your device to then have it run for which colors appear in the image. A list of colors and percents is generated and the user can touch in locations to also see which color is in a specific spot.

You can save the results of images to your device and load them back up without the app having to process it again to save time.

An optional toggle called "Precise mode" is planned where the app will either show true percentages or account for minute amounts of a color and choose the best place to "allocate" them to. That is, if an image has 35.1% red and 1.4% orange mixed within the red, it will simply list to the user 36.5% red.

This app was an educational app made by three students at The University of Texas at Austin, Robert Montefusco, Yajie Niu, and Tony Sampson, while in our Android Development class. We decided to make an app that may help people with some sort of disability that may be overlooked, such as colorblindness.

We hope to rewrite the app more closely following the Android Design Guidelines in the future.
